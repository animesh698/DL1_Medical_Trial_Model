# DL1_Medical_Trial_Model
A simple Deep Learning model using Keras and Tensorflow to determine if a patient has an adverse reaction or not to an experimental drug.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
An experimental drug was tested on individuals from ages 13 to 65.
The trial had 2100 participants.Half were under 65 years old,half were over 65 years old.
95% of patients 65 or older experienced side effects. 
95% of patients under 65 experienced no side effects. 


## PIPELINE:
Samples and lables have been generated using randint function(Numerical input data).
The model makes use of the Keras sequential model with 3 Dense layers and "relu" as the activation function.
Confusion matrix to represent output.

## RUN:
Run the file keras_1.py in your tensorflow environment.

 
## OUTPUT:
